        Created a website dedicated for a humanoid robot named Pepper.
        to fulfill its role as a School receptionist. The website is
        designed to guide guests and students alike about schedules,
        specific areas in the school, and upcoming or current events.<br></div>
        <div><p style = "text-align: center; font-weight: bold"> Light show design and program</p><br>
        Helped design and program light show algorithms to be used in sync with music.
        A song or track will be played, and a sequence will be made to fit the song,
        which will be reflected onto the physical lights attached to the front of a 
        building. The sequence files will be played in a computer handled by a
        person.<br></div>
