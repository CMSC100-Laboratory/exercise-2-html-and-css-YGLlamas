Steps:
    - Cloned the repository in Github classroom locally
    - set visibility to public and set the source for Github pages to main
    - created an index file to create static website
    - pushed the file into the repository
    - used the link above to check on it
It is a bit slow when having to check the website over and over, as the updated
version doesn't load immediately. However, this is one way to create a static website,
while using Git at the same time.
